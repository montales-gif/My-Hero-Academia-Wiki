  <h1>Shigaraki Tomura</h1>

  <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
  <div class="hero-section">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Shigaraki Tomura, born Tenko Shimura, is the primary antagonist of *My Hero Academia* 
      and the successor to All For One. Once a terrified child abandoned by society, his life 
      was shattered when his dormant Quirk activated, accidentally killing his own family. 
      Manipulated and taken in by All For One, he was shaped into the symbol of villainy 
      designed to bring down the hero society. 
      <br><br>
      Over time, Shigaraki evolves from a directionless villain into a calculated and terrifying 
      leader. His hatred toward society is rooted in trauma, neglect, and the belief that the hero 
      system failed him and countless others. With his Decay quirk awakening to new heights 
      and his body enhanced through experimentation, Shigaraki becomes one of the most 
      destructive forces in the series—capable of wiping out entire cities with a single touch.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- ABILITIES -->
  <div class="hero-section">
    <h2>Abilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Decay:</strong> His primary Quirk. Anything he touches with all five fingers 
        disintegrates instantly. After awakening, Decay spreads beyond direct contact, 
        crawling across surfaces and destroying everything in its path—including entire landscapes.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Enhanced Physical Power:</strong> Following intense modifications by Dr. Garaki, 
        Shigaraki’s strength, durability, and mobility increase to superhuman levels, allowing him 
        to fight Pro Heroes head-on.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>High-Speed Regeneration:</strong> One of his most terrifying enhancements. 
        Shigaraki can heal from fatal wounds in seconds, making him extremely difficult to defeat.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Multiple Quirk Access (Post-Enhancements):</strong> After being modified to become 
        the next vessel for All For One, Shigaraki gains access to an arsenal of additional quirks 
        such as air-walking, search, and superhuman strength-based abilities.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Tactical Intelligence:</strong> Despite his chaotic nature, Shigaraki is a strategic thinker. 
        He rapidly adapts during battle, exploits weaknesses, and leads his forces with growing maturity.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- FUN FACTS -->
  <div class="hero-section">
    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The hands he wears on his body are the remains of his deceased family—an emotional anchor 
        crafted by All For One to mold him into a perfect villain.
      </li>
      <li>
        His constant scratching is a psychological reaction to stress, guilt, and trauma.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shigaraki is the grandson of Nana Shimura, the 7th user of One For All, making him directly 
        connected to the legacy of heroism he aims to destroy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before becoming a villain, Shigaraki was found crying on the streets for days. No hero 
        stopped to help him, fueling his deep resentment toward the hero society.
      </li>
      <li>
        His design and personality evolve throughout the series—from a childish, unstable villain 
        into one of the most intimidating antagonists in modern anime.
      </li>
    </ul>
